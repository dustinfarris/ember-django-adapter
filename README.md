Ember Django Adapter
====================

This Ember addon enables the use of [Django REST Framework][] as an API
backend. The addon is compatible with [ember-cli][] version 0.1.0 and higher.

Goals
-----

* Ability to support Django REST Framework APIs without modifications to the default configuration of Django REST
  Framework.

* Ensure as much as posslibe that the documentation on emberjs.com about adapters and serializers is accurate and
  relevant when using the Django REST adapter and serializer. Deviations from the emberjs.com documentation should be
  documented clearly.

* Optionally enable some features from Django REST Framework which would require users to setup or configure their APIs
  in a specific manner. An example of this is retrieving hasMany records using query params as configured with Django
  REST Framework and django-filter.


Community
---------

* IRC: #ember-django-adapter on freenode
* Issues: [ember-django-adapter/issues][]


Installation
------------

From within your Ember CLI application, run the following:

```console
npm i --save-dev ember-django-adapter
```


Configuration
-------------

In your app settings in `config/environment.js`, set the hostname for your API,
e.g.:

```js
if (environment === 'development') {
  ENV.APP.API_HOST = 'http://localhost:8000';
}

if (environment === 'production') {
  ENV.APP.API_HOST = 'https://api.myproject.org';
  ENV.APP.API_NAMESPACE = '';
}
```

### Configuration Options

* API_HOST: The server hosting your API _(default: None)_
* API_NAMESPACE: Your API namespace _(default: 'api')_


Extending
---------

Installing the adapter and setting `API_HOST` should satisfy most requirements,
but if you want to add your own customizations:

### Custom Adapter

```console
ember generate django-adapter my-custom-adapter
```

### Custom Serializer

```console
ember generate django-serializer my-custom-serializer
```

## Path Customization

By default the DjangoRESTAdapter will attempt to use the pluralized lowercase model name to generate the path name. This
allows some features in Django REST Framework to work by default. If this convention is not suitable for your needs,
you can override the pathForType method.

For example, if you do not want to use the default lowercase model names and needed dashed-case instead, you would
override the pathForType method like this:

```js
App.ApplicationAdapter = DS.DjangoRESTAdapter.extend({
  pathForType: function(type) {
    var dasherized = Ember.String.dasherize(type);
    return Ember.String.pluralize(dasherized);
  }
});
```

Requests for App.User would now target /users/1. Requests for App.UserProfile would now target /user-profiles/1.


## coalesceFindRequests option

This adapter does not support the coalesceFindRequests option. The Django REST Framework does not offer easy to
configure support for N+1 query requests in the format that Ember Data uses (e.g. `GET /comments?ids[]=1&ids[]=2`)

See the Ember documentation about coalesceFindRequests for information about this option [coalesce-find-requests-option][].
